# Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial was a company that dealt with consulting, that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons.  They wanted me to develop secure web services for their company to business over and address any security issues they were having.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

What I did well was finding several vulnerabilities in the code they were using, it is important to code securely because if you do not you leave the potential for threats that can cost you enormously.  Software security adds to a company's well being by stopping threats that can ruin a company. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

Working through the vulnerability assessment was challenging at times but also helpful it gave a guide of what areas to look into but was sort of vague of what to look at.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

Well after doing a manual security evaluation of the code I would run the vulnerability checker to determine a second layer of security.  Research on vulnerabilities and there solutions is the strategy I use to determine mitigation.  Often a software upgrade is needed, other times features need disabled or code may need to be generated to code a solution.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

In the beginning I evaluate the code manually and inspect it then I build the application with dependency checker.  To see if I have added new vulnerabilities I re-build the code and run the dependency checker again to see if any new vulnerabilities have been added.  The main resource I use is the internet when I get stuck, I can usually search and find what I am looking for on stack overflow or other web sites.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I feel that the Hex generation of my name on the HTTPS site is a nice accomplishment.  The program did not have the keystore and application properties in it and that was a challenge to set up.
